# Bootstrap Practice Projects

In order to learn how to use Bootstrap 4, I followed an online course made by Brad Traversy.
During this course I created several projects - all fully responsive websites using Bootstrap. 

All projects are built with simple HTML, CSS and a little bit of jQuery as the main goal of the course was to practice with Bootstrap.

You can find all projects deployed on https://bootstrap-practice-projects.netlify.com/
